    <p>Birds aren't real. they were created by the government to deliver vaccines through the air. Once these 
    "vaccines" enter your bloodstream you start to believe that the moon is a naturally occuring phenonmenon, when it was actually constructed by 
    space nazis in 1953, to spy on AMERICAN citizens! WAKE UP SHEEPLE!!!!1!! OH and if you think thats freaky wait until I tell you about the giraffes.</p>
